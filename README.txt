The above output shows a timeline where "+" depicts added lines and "-" depicts removed lines. A "." means that there were changes by that author during that week but the amount of work was very small in relation to the rest of the work that week.

The number of signs in no way describes the size of the work, rather, it is the amount of work each week in relation to the other authors.
